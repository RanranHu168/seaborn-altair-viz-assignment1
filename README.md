# Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Visualization with Python

This repository contains the completed solutions for **Assignment 1** of the course _Exploratory Data Visualization Methods with Python_ at UMass Dartmouth.

The assignment explores the use of **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Altair** for visualizing population and Spotify data. All code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“˜ Assignment Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 1: Seaborn Heatmap
- Generate a heatmap showing the percentage of age groups in each U.S. state (2012 data).
- Regenerate the heatmap sorted in descending order by "Under 5 years" and "5 to 9 years".

### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 2: Altair / Seaborn
- Create a function that visualizes the population distribution by age group across years using percentage values.

### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 3: Population Pyramid using Matplotlib
- Build a function to generate a population pyramid (age-gender distribution) for a selected state.
- Apply the function to display pyramids for all U.S. states.

### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 4: Spotify Listening Behavior
- Load Spotify listening data from a public JSON file.
- Plot a multi-line chart showing total listening time by hour of day for each quarter of the year.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Altair
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)

## ðŸ“Ž File
